# Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
# While Loop
# Syntax:
# while expression:
#   statement(s)


# The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
# We generally use this loop when we don't know beforehand, the number of times to iterate.
# While loops, like the ForLoop, are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a for loop, the while loop will not run n times, but until a defined condition is no longer met. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all.

# prints Hello G 3 Times 
count = 0
while (count < 3):     
    count = count+1
    print("Hello")
